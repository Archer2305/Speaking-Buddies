<h2 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered has-text-white" id="intro_para"><br />
<br />
COVID-19 has impacted many around the world; everyone&#39;s community life, social life,<br />
and daily interaction is now gone. This meant the possibility to interact with a fluent<br />
English speaker for these underprivileged students would be even harder. After connecting<br />
with students, we were seeing that although many of the students were putting in hour<br />
after an hour into learning English, they had no one to practice with. With this, we realized<br />
that since English is our first language why not carry an interesting and smooth conversation<br />
which would be a fun way to practice new English? And from there it has blossomed into the<br />
organization we are now.<br />

My buddy is so much of a help for me because sometimes I don&#39;t know how to explain the situation<br />
so that time she helps me with my English. There are many times I don&#39;t know some of vocabulary<br />
so that time she gives me a word to help. I can easily share my things or thought with her. There are<br />
many times she motivates me to do my best. She has done many things for me.<br />

I love volunteering through speaking buddies because it gives me the opportunity to make new friends<br />
while also allowing me to learn so much about a different culture and environment. Not only do I learn<br />
something new about my speaking buddy&rsquo;s life and routine in India, but I also have someone I can<br />
talk to about all the interesting things happening in the USA. Having these joyful light conversations<br />
never fail to bring a smile to my face and is something I always look forward to every week.<br />

I would really recommend the experience that Speaking Buddies provides, to all high schoolers.The program<br />
provides a way for students to connect with other people across the world. While it allows my speaking buddy<br />
to practice his English skills,it also provides me with a way to dive deeper into his culture and learn about<br />
his social and academic life thereby,broadening my understanding.<br />

Speaking buddies is an opportunity like I have never seen before. We are given the ability to connect with new<br />
people across the world and it&rsquo;s a great way to make new friends.It&rsquo;s a relaxed conversation between two<br />
people and gives each person freedom to talk openly with the other.I always have a great time talking to my<br />
buddies and it&rsquo;s so nice to hear stories about what is happening in their life. My buddies and I<br />
have created great friendships that I hope to strengthen more in the future.<br />

Speaking buddies is a great opportunity to socialize with people your age,from overseas and help them improve<br />
their English speaking skills. I have a great time talking with my buddy. Through our conversations, I was able<br />
to correct his English and get to know a lot about him. This experience is great overall and I highly recommend<br />
it to anyone that is interested.<br />
